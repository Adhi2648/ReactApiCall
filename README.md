#Method used to solve the problem:

###Time taken: 30 mins

> Used useState hook to get the data from the api and store it in the state 'post' and another state 'loading' to either true or false depending on wether the data has been obtained from the API.

> Used the fetch function inside the handleClick function to get data from the Api given and store it in the setPost.

> Returned the data in the post state in a css grid and used inline css to style the grid container and elements.

> Used the map function to get the individual elements from the state and display them each in their own grid container.
